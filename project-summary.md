   - Meaningful micro-interactions (glowing effects, subtle movements)
   - Gesture-based controls (drag-and-drop for Virtual Altar)

4. **State Management**
   - Redux store organization by feature domains
   - Optimized re-renders with selective state subscriptions
   - Local component state for UI-specific interactions

5. **Responsive Design**
   - Flexible layouts that work across devices
   - Touch-friendly interface elements
   - Appropriate spacing and sizing for mobile and desktop

## User Experience Highlights

1. **Customer-Centric Approach**
